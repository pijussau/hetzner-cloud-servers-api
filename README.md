Deploy 100's of Hetzner Cloud on Autopilot

This is a fun project I made for catching domains several years ago. I had to deploy 10+ hetzner cloud servers to regularly check whois records for upcoming drops. When the domain dropped, I quickly register it with Openprovider NL.

To use this PHP script you need to obtain access tokens from your Hetzner Account. You should also contact their support desks to increase your server limit from 10 to 25 servers.
